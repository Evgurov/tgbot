# Telegram Bot in C++
This project features my Telegram bot, entirely written in C++. The project is currently under development and is being developed by *Evgeny Gurov*.

## Contents:
* **Basic Telegram Bot Class and Test Inherited Bot Class:**
  * The project includes a basic Telegram bot class and a test inherited bot class. The inherited class can send messages to both group chats and private messages in response to messages from chat         participants. It also reacts to the addition or removal of chat participants and adding a bot to the chat.

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Advantages:**
  * Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming tools, the bot's capabilities are easily extensible. This design approach also allows for seamless support for several bots with different functionalities.
* **Simple Tests:**
  * The project incorporates simple tests for the bot. These tests utilize a fake server, simulating a server with the Telegram API.
